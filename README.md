## üìú Overview

This smart contract implements a **decentralized will registry** that:

* Lets users **lock Aptos Coins (APT)** for a recipient.
* Allows recipients to **claim funds** after a timeout period if the owner doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúping‚Äù to confirm activity.
* Maintains a **global registry** mapping recipients to multiple will creators.

It ensures a **trustless inheritance process** ‚Äî no third party, no intermediaries.

‚úÖ **Ping System** ‚Äì Owners can update activity to reset their timer.
‚úÖ **Auto-Claim Logic** ‚Äì Recipients can claim assets once the timeout expires.
‚úÖ **Global Will Registry** ‚Äì Tracks multiple wills per recipient.
‚úÖ **View Functions** ‚Äì Retrieve wills, claimable wills, and counts easily.

## üöÄ How to Use

1. **Deploy the contract** on Aptos testnet.
2. Call `initialize_global_registry()` (only once).
3. Each user runs `initialize()` to create their WillState.
4. Use `create_will()` to set up a new will with amount and recipient.
5. Regularly call `ping()` to stay active.
6. Recipient calls `claim()` or `claim_single()` when the timeout passes.
